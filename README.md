# Denoising-GAN
A denoising GAN which would denoise images with gaussian noise of standard deviation 25 and 50 is in this repository.
The datset consisted 800 images of different classes for training and 100 images of different classes for validation.
GAN was built by using unet architecture and used convoultion layers to decode and encode the noised images.
